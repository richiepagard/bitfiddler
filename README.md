# Bitfiddler || Low-Level Playground

A personal collection of small experiments in low-level programming, mostly in C — sometimes other old-school stuff (e.g., Perl or Bash).

This is not a library, framework, or anything reusable. It's just code I write to understand how things work under the hood.

## Why This Repo Exists

I'm curious about how things really work at the lower levels of software — where there are no abstractions. This is my way of learning, taking notes, and keeping track of what I explore.

## How to Use

You probably don't need to — but if you're also curious about low-level stuff, feel free to browse, compile, and run things.

## Notes

- Mostly tested on Debian
- Code might be heavily commented to explain what I’m doing
- Some things may break or be incomplete — that’s part of the process
- I love low-level programming, old-school tools, and open-source. So I try to deeply understand what I implement here — because that love runs deep.
