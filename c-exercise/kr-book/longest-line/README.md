## Notes

- Learned about the limitation capacity of arrays.
- Understood the **null-terminator** whcih is the determined of end of the word(character array). Appears as `'\0'` symbol!
- Really understood and see the different between `>` and `>=` :')
- Understood the placement and proper time of reset the value of a variable in checking something, and revised the **Two Pointer** technique of solving problems.
- Read and understood the **Buffer Overflow** security bug and how to fix it (just in this script).
